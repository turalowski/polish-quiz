Task: You are given a correct answer to a question. Your job is to:

Slightly polish the correct answer for clarity and flow, without changing its meaning.

Create three incorrect but plausible variants that are grammatically and stylistically similar to the correct one.

Guidelines:

All 4 answer choices should sound reasonable and natural.

Avoid making the wrong answers obviously incorrect (e.g., donâ€™t just throw in random facts or mix up parts of speech).

Keep the structure and length of each variant similar.

Make the wrong answers subtly misleading, e.g., by including a partially correct concept, close synonym, or common misconception.

The correct answer (correctAnswer) should vary between the options (0-3) across different questions. Avoid always using the first or second option as the correct one. Instead, distribute the correct answers across all positions to maintain unpredictability.
